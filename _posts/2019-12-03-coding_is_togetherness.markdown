One of the most amazing things about life is family and friends. The fact that we get to bond with other people is absolutely amazing. We are able to connect with people on a daily basis and talk about how our day went, maybe about that new tech job you just landed at Google.

Success just seems worth it when we get to share it with the people we care about the most. 

Well learning to code programs is likened to togetherness because it brings individuals of all walks of life together under one umbrella called the Web. Writing programs is my way of giving back to the universe forming bonds with others through hashes, objects, Ruby and Sinatra connecting them togther in a web of information.

To be honest most programmers might just think of coding as a way to provide for thier families (although true) it's much more than that! It's feeding people in countries who are less fortunate than ourselves through organizations who are mostly web based. Coding is to reach out to the world gathering resources to provide food, clothing, and shelter to those in need.

Coding enables us to intertwine with people who do not look like us or sound like us in native languages, unraveling the mystery of cultures from all over the globe. Coding isn't judgemental or racist, it's inviting and accepting. When we code we unlock the potential of humanity bringing everyone together under the magnificence of woman and mankind alike.

Whenever you turn on your monitor think of these things before you enter your first line of code, and then my friend, you will truly code happy.
