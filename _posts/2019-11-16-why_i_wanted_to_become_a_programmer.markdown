Life is hard enough isn't it? without wanting to add more on top of our normal daily tasks in our lives. So why would anyone want to be a full-stack developer, well because it's awesome, that's why!

We use technology in every area of our lives whether we know it or not. Quite frankly, there isn't to many companies in our world that does not use tech in one form or another, so a career in tech is certainly a smart career choice, a career in tech is in high demand. Not to mention the salaries aren't bad either, one could reel in six figure digits easily (with study).

I always thought it would be awesome to be a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software. Learning how to manipulate data and programming objects to do tasks on command. This to me is likened to a form of being a super hero of some sort. Transforming the web on command.Â ![](http://)

On a serious note, I wanted to become a programmer to do something that was difficult, to push the envelope of what my true capabilities are. To learn more about myself and push my fibers to the limit with innovation. I admit this choice hasn't let me down, it's tough, but worth it.
