One of the most burning questions I get when I tell people that I'm studying to be a Full-Stack Web Developer, is, "Is learning to code fun"?  I hesitate whenever I get asked that question because the  first thing I would have to do is have a general idea of what fun means to that person. I mean going to the beach is pretty fun isn't it? that's an activity that people love doing, so it's difficult to answer that question on face value.


So I'll ask you, what do you consider fun? If your answer is learning a wealth of knowledge that holds the potential to change the world then, Yes, coding would be fun for an individual like yourself. 

Coding isn't for everyone because some people don't find studying various programming languages like Ruby, Java, and Python exciting in particular. You can make coding fun. if your not the reading type then you could find other ways to have fun while learning. One way to make learning to code more thrilling is by searching Youtube for various videos on "How To" make a hash or perhaps how to work with objects in Ruby.

When we think of ways to entertain ourselves we come up with a rather large list of things we could do. However when something we would probobaly like to do or achieve for that matter seems boring or mundane we tend to shy away from it like the the plague. 

Just like we can be quite clever when it comes to having fun in areas like sports and other activities we could find ways to make coding exciting to us. Perhaps you could learn coding with a friend, when we bring others into learning it can keep us on target and invested. As I mentioned before videos are great tools for education and can keep us alert as we comb through functions and methods. If we want something bad enough will figure out a way to ingest it in a fashion that holds our attention, you just have to make it n for you.

So to answer the question, Is coding fun?, My answer is Yes, you just have to know how to make it fun for you.
